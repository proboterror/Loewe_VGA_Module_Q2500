# Loewe TVs Q2500 VGA Module
Recreation of VGA module PCB for Loewe TVs with Q2500M chassis.

Project based on work done by Oelii from [circuit-board.de/forum](https://circuit-board.de/forum/index.php/Thread/28516-WIP-DIY-Loewe-VGA-Modul-Q2500/)

Schematic recreated from the scratch in KiCad. PCB based on Oelii's layout and verified with Desing/Electrical Rules Checker tools.<br>
Components footprints replaced with KiCad standard ones.

## Chassis compatibility
Unverified, obtained from post by djcalle on [circuit-board.de/forum](https://circuit-board.de/forum/index.php/Thread/28516-WIP-DIY-Loewe-VGA-Modul-Q2500/?postID=906980#post906980):
- Q23, Q24, Q25 can accept VGA cards.
- Q25 and Q24 use the same VGA card (only 2 differences: cable length and 150R termination on RGB lines.)
- Q25 seems to be inconsistent with VGA card compatibility.
- Q24 seems consistent with vga card compatibility.
- Q23 uses its own different card.

## Build Notes
L816 and L826 L3225 size SMD inductors value are unknown; replace with 0R resistor or solder bridge.

W831 connector originally is Molex 22-23-2121. Probably can be replaced with XH 2.54 12 pin connectors / cables.
Pay attention on cable connectors type: same direction or reverse direction.
Most cable are up to 30 cm, sometimes 50 cm. Measure what you need before ordering. 

**Double-check ground and VCC connection on VGA module PCB and TV chassis before soldering 12-pin W831 connector and power on.**
